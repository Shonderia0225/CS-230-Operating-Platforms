# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The gaming room, client, desired preparing their game, Draw It or Lose It into a multi-platform web-based application. It was aimed at enabling several players and teams to compete simultaneously using various devices, without compromising the game in terms of its security, responsiveness, and scalability. It was my role to make the software such that it was capable of supporting these requirements and operating effectively on various operating systems.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe I was very successful in describing the architecture and platform recommendations in a logical and coherent manner. I ensured that the document demonstrated the functionality of each element of the system and why the design adopted was most suitable to the needs of the client.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document enabled me to plan it through properly before I thought about the code. It simplified the way of breaking the project into small segments and how all of it connects. The fact that it had such a structure made it less daunting when it came to thinking about how the software was going to work.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
One aspect that I would change is the section on scalability and performance that I would rather rewrite to include more information. I might have provided more instances on how the system would serve a huge number of users or data without slacking.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I also took into consideration what the users would desire as I developed the system. The game was to be user friendly, visually clear and quick in responding. It is worth concentrating on the needs of the users since it will make the software more entertaining and maintain the interest of people. Even the technical work can fail to make the best design unless the user is taken into consideration.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I came in with the idea that I would first get the requirements completely understood and then draw the system design and not get into the technicalities. I applied the modular design approach in order to make each component of the system buildable and testable. The same method would be applied to me in the future, starting with effective planning, clear documentation and user experience kept in mind during the process.
